Bosco Roadmap

- Remove asset minification in current form and just have it programmatically drive webpack (or do nothing?)
  - If we can make this work does it give us live reload and other features that we're after?
  - Can this be done in a way that isn't massively impactful across old services?

- Refactor commonality (where possible?) out of commands and allow those parts to be more easily tested.
